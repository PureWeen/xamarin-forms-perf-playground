# Xamarin.Forms Performance Playground

There are many techniques for increasing the **performance** of Xamarin.Forms applications. Collectively these techniques can greatly reduce the amount of work being performed by a CPU, and the amount of memory consumed by an application. This repository describes and discusses these techniques.
